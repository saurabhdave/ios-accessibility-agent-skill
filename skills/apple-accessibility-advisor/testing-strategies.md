# Accessibility Testing Strategies

A robust testing regimen ensures that patterns and guidelines are actually met in the
final product. This document describes approaches for manual validation, automated
checks, and integration into your development workflow.

---

## 1. Manual Validation

### VoiceOver, Switch Control & Assistive Technologies
- Enable VoiceOver/VoiceOver for iPad, Zoom, Switch Control, or other relevant
  assistive technologies on a physical device and navigate every screen.
- On watchOS test with the Watch’s VoiceOver and on tvOS use the Remote or
  Siri Remote to verify focus and announcements.
- Verify labels, hints, and custom actions are announced correctly across platforms.
- Ensure reading order matches expected UX and that grouped elements make sense.

### Dynamic Type & Appearance
- Cycle through all content size categories in Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size.
- Test in both light and dark mode to catch contrast issues.
- Turn on Reduce Motion and verify that animations are disabled or simplified.

### Color Contrast
- Use the Accessibility Inspector or online contrast checkers (e.g. WebAIM) with screenshots.
- Confirm that text and interactive elements meet WCAG ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large).

### Real-World Use Cases
- Ask users or QA engineers who rely on assistive technologies to try the app.
- Record sessions to catch unexpected behaviors or mispronunciations.

## 2. Automated Tests

### Unit Tests with XCTest
- Expose `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityValue`, etc. and verify expected values.

```swift
func testProfileRowAccessibility() {
    let row = ProfileRow(user: testUser)
    let label = row.accessibilityLabel()
    XCTAssertEqual(label, "John Doe, Designer")
}
```

### UI Tests
- Assign `accessibilityIdentifier` to critical elements and refer to them in tests.

```swift
let deleteButton = app.buttons["deleteButton"]
XCTAssertTrue(deleteButton.exists)
deleteButton.tap()
```

- Use `XCUIElement`’s `label`, `value`, and `isHittable` to assert properties.

### Snapshot & Regression
- Capture screenshots with VoiceOver enabled to ensure nothing shifts visually.
- Compare against baseline images in CI to catch layout regressions at large text sizes.

---

## 3. Continuous Integration

- Run UI tests on multiple simulators configured with different accessibility settings.
- Incorporate accessibility linting tools (e.g., `axe-core` for web components or custom Swift scripts) in build pipelines.
- Fail builds if accessibility identifiers are missing or if critical labels are empty.

---

## 4. Tools & Resources

- **Accessibility Inspector** (Xcode) – inspect view hierarchy, simulate traits.
- **VoiceOver Practice** – built into iOS for training and verifying gestures.
- **Accessibility Audit APIs** – use `UIAccessibility` notifications to detect issues runtime.

Testing is not a one‑time step; it should be part of every feature branch and code review. A mix
of manual exploration and automated assertions gives you confidence that the application
remains accessible as it evolves.
