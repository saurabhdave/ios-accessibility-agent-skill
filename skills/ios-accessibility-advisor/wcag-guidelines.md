# WCAG Guidelines for iOS/macOS

While WCAG originated for web content, its success criteria are broadly applicable to
native applications. The following summary highlights key points to consider when
building Apple platforms software.

---

## 1. Perceivable

- **Text Alternatives (1.1.1)**: Provide accessibility labels for non‑text content such as
  icons or images. Use `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint`.
- **Adaptable (1.3.1)**: Ensure content is structured so that assistive technologies can
  interpret it. In SwiftUI, use `accessibilityElement(children:)` and grouping effectively.
- **Distinguishable (1.4.x)**: Maintain contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for normal text
  and 3:1 for large text. Avoid conveying information by color alone; combine with icons or
  text.

### Mobile-specific
- **Orientation (1.3.4)**: Support both portrait and landscape unless a rotation is
  essential.
- **Resize Text (1.4.4)**: Respect Dynamic Type and never clip or truncate at larger size
  categories.
- **Motion (1.4.11)**: Provide options to reduce motion or remove animations.

## 2. Operable

- **Keyboard Accessible (2.1.1)**: On macOS ensure all interactive elements are reachable
  using the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space). For iOS, ensure VoiceOver gesture equivalents
  exist for custom interactions.
- **Enough Time (2.2.1)**: Allow users to extend time limits or disable auto‑advancing
  screens when supported.
- **Seizures (2.3.1)**: Avoid content that flashes more than three times per second.
- **Navigable (2.4.x)**: Provide clear navigation order, landmarks, and focus indicators.

---

## 3. Understandable

- **Readable (3.1.1)**: Use clear language and supply localized strings for all user‑visible
  text, including accessibility labels.
- **Predictable (3.2.x)**: UI components should behave consistently; avoid unexpected changes
  in context when activated.
- **Input Assistance (3.3.x)**: Offer help when form fields are invalid, through hints or
  alerts that are accessible to VoiceOver.

---

## 4. Robust

- **Compatible (4.1.2)**: Follow platform APIs correctly so that assistive technologies can
  parse UI elements. For example, avoid layering views that obscure accessibility elements.
- **Name, Role, Value (4.1.2)**: Ensure every element has an appropriate label (name), a role
  (button, header, switch), and current value if applicable.

---

## Mapping to Apple APIs
- Use `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityValue`, `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityTraits`.
- Declaring `accessibilityElements` or using SwiftUI modifiers like
  `.accessibilityElement(children:)` helps satisfy structural criteria.
- Leverage `UIAccessibility` notifications (e.g. `announcement`) to communicate dynamic changes.

Keeping WCAG success criteria in mind during design and development helps make your
application accessible to the broadest audience, including users with visual, motor,
or cognitive disabilities.
